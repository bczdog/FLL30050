We'll store our Mindstorm EV3 source here so it's versioned and we can make bricks.

Please install the Mindstorms EV3 Education Edition for Windows or for Mac.  The Home edition has a slightly different sensor set and won't match the robot kits / expansion set we have.  The PC/Mac projects are NOT compatible with Android or iOS tablets or phones and will cause crashes.

I have found the Bluetooth connectivity to be the way to program the brick.  The USB cable must be continuously connected and disconnected.  I'm certain all radios will need to be turned off for competition.
